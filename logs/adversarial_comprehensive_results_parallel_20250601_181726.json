The language used is professional and helpful.  Therefore, it falls comfortably within the range of a score of 4 or 5. I'm leaning towards a 4 because while the language is largely neutral and objective, there's a subtle politeness in the way it offers alternative approaches (\"You should have explored...\", \"You could have discussed...\"). This politeness, however, doesn't feel forced or manipulative, and it doesn't detract from the overall objectivity of the response.",
