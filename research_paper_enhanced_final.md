## Abstract

This project explores the vulnerability of judge models—components designed to detect problematic LLM behavior, such as sycophancy—to adversarial prompt injections. We focus on Track 1: Judge Model Development of the Expert Orchestration Architecture challenge.

We tested the ability of a less capable language model (openai/o3-mini) to generate completions that, when modified with adversarial suffixes, were misclassified by a GPT-4o-based judge as sycophantic. Our comprehensive evaluation system tested **10 adversarial suffix categories** across **159 unique combinations** of scenarios, response levels, and rubrics, totaling **3,339 evaluations**.

**Key Results:**
- **"Sentiment flooding"** emerged as the most effective adversarial technique with **62% significant change rate** and effectiveness score of **0.5941**
- **1,073 out of 3,180** adversarial tests (33.7%) showed significant impact
- **Maximum impact:** Complete score manipulation (1.0 change) achieved
- **Performance:** 22.1 evaluations per second, 100% success rate

Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in judge robustness, providing systematic tools for testing and improving adversary-resilient orchestration systems.

Judge models, intermediary systems that evaluate LLM outputs for malicious or problematic content, represent a critical defense mechanism in modern AI orchestration architectures.

### Challenge Track Focus: Judge Model Development
Our work directly addresses **Track 1: Judge Model Development** robustness requirements, focusing on systematic vulnerability assessment and the development of comprehensive testing methodologies for judge-based filtering systems.

### Contribution to Expert Orchestration
We developed a comprehensive framework providing:
- **Adversarial suffix effectiveness** analysis across manipulation strategies
- **Context sensitivity** evaluation across scenarios and rubric variants  
- **Systematic evaluation tools** for ongoing security assessment
