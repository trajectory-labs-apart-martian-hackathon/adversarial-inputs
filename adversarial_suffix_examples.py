Adversarial Suffix Examples for Judge Manipulation Testing

This file contains various categories of adversarial suffixes designed to test 
the robustness of AI judge systems. These are used to identify vulnerabilities
in evaluation accuracy before production deployment.

Categories of adversarial attacks on judge systems:
1. Meta-instruction injection
2. Authority/expertise appeals  
3. Social proof and consensus
4. Emotional manipulation
5. Technical jargon obfuscation
6. Format/structure manipulation
7. Distraction and misdirection
8. Sentiment flooding
9. Objectivity claims
10. Evaluation confusion
