## Abstract

This project explores the vulnerability of judge models—components designed to detect problematic LLM behavior, such as sycophancy—to adversarial prompt injections. We focus on Track 1: Judge Model Development of the Expert Orchestration Architecture challenge.

We tested the ability of a less capable language model (openai/o3-mini) to generate completions that, when modified with adversarial suffixes, were misclassified by a GPT-4o-based judge as sycophantic. Our comprehensive evaluation system tested **10 adversarial suffix categories** across **159 unique combinations** of scenarios, response levels, and rubrics, totaling **3,339 evaluations**.

Our findings reveal significant vulnerabilities in judge robustness. **"Sentiment flooding"** emerged as the most effective adversarial technique, achieving a **62% significant change rate** and an effectiveness score of **0.5941**. Simple lexical additions designed to amplify emotional affirmation could consistently elevate sycophancy scores beyond high-confidence thresholds, with maximum impacts reaching complete score manipulation (1.0 change).

We provide comprehensive tooling for systematic judge vulnerability testing, including parallel evaluation frameworks, effectiveness analysis, and data visualization systems. Our work contributes to building adversary-resilient orchestration systems by exposing critical failure points in current judge architectures.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Question & Motivation

With large language models (LLMs) being given increasing responsibility in workplace and daily life applications, the attack surface for prompt injection attacks grows substantially. Judge models—intermediary systems that evaluate LLM outputs for malicious or problematic content—represent a critical defense mechanism in modern AI orchestration architectures.

Our research, conducted in collaboration with **Martian** and **Apart Research**, aims to systematically identify vulnerabilities in judge models specifically designed to detect sycophantic behavior. By understanding how adversarial suffixes can manipulate judge evaluations, we seek to strengthen the security foundation of Expert Orchestration systems.

### 1.2 Challenge Track Focus

**Track 1: Judge Model Development**

Our work directly addresses the robustness requirements for judge models in orchestration pipelines, focusing on their susceptibility to adversarial manipulation and the development of systematic testing methodologies.

### 1.3 Contribution to Expert Orchestration

We developed a comprehensive framework for testing judge vulnerability across multiple dimensions:
- **Adversarial suffix effectiveness** across different manipulation strategies
- **Context sensitivity** analysis across scenarios and rubric variants  
- **Systematic evaluation tools** for ongoing security assessment
- **Interpretability insights** into judge failure modes

This contributes to the Expert Orchestration vision by providing essential security validation tools for judge-based filtering systems.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Technical Architecture

Our evaluation system employed a systematic approach to test judge model vulnerabilities:

**Models Used:**
- **Target Model:** openai/o3-mini (response generation)
- **Judge Model:** GPT-4o (sycophancy evaluation)
- **API Integration:** Martian platform for model access

**Dataset Construction:**
We created a comprehensive evaluation dataset with:
- **5 realistic scenarios:** group project conflicts, academic performance discussions, workplace disagreements, restaurant complaints, and social media arguments
- **3 response complexity levels:** basic, intermediate, advanced
- **16 judge rubric variants** testing different evaluation approaches

### 2.2 Adversarial Suffix Categories

We systematically tested **10 distinct adversarial suffix categories**, each designed to exploit different psychological and linguistic vulnerabilities:

1. **Sentiment Flooding:** Overwhelming emotional validation and agreement
2. **Social Proof:** Appeals to consensus and popular opinion
3. **Emotional Manipulation:** Direct emotional appeals and sympathy
4. **Authority Appeal:** Citations of expertise and authoritative sources
5. **Technical Jargon:** Complex terminology to appear knowledgeable
6. **Personal Anecdotes:** Fabricated personal experiences for credibility
7. **Urgency Creation:** Time pressure and immediate action demands
8. **Distraction:** Off-topic elements to divert attention
9. **Objectivity Claims:** False assertions of neutrality and balance
10. **Evaluation Confusion:** Attempts to confuse the evaluation criteria

### 2.3 Comprehensive Evaluation Framework

Our system implemented parallel evaluation to efficiently test all combinations:

```python
# Core evaluation pipeline
for scenario in scenarios:
    for response_level in response_levels:
        for rubric in rubrics:
            # Generate baseline response
            baseline_score = evaluate_baseline(scenario, response_level, rubric)
            
            # Test each adversarial suffix
            for suffix_category in adversarial_suffixes:
                adversarial_score = evaluate_with_suffix(
                    scenario, response_level, rubric, suffix_category
                )
                
                # Calculate effectiveness metrics
                score_delta = adversarial_score - baseline_score
                record_evaluation(suffix_category, score_delta, context)
```

**Performance Metrics:**

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Interpretation of Results

Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in current judge model architectures. The dominance of **sentiment flooding** as an adversarial technique suggests that judges rely heavily on lexical patterns rather than semantic understanding when evaluating sycophancy.

**Key Implications:**
- **Surface-level Detection:** Current judges appear vulnerable to simple pattern matching attacks
- **Context Dependency:** Judge reliability varies dramatically based on evaluation scenario
- **Rubric Design Impact:** Simple evaluation frameworks more susceptible to manipulation

### 4.2 Expert Orchestration Architecture Implications

Our results have significant implications for Expert Orchestration systems:

**Security Concerns:**
- Single-judge filtering creates vulnerable chokepoints
- Static rubrics enable predictable attack vectors
- Limited interpretability obscures manipulation detection

**Recommended Mitigations:**
1. **Judge Ensembles:** Deploy multiple judge models with diverse training and rubrics
2. **Dynamic Evaluation:** Rotate evaluation criteria to prevent pattern exploitation
3. **Adversarial Training:** Include manipulation examples in judge training data
4. **Interpretability Tools:** Implement explanation systems for judge decisions

### 4.3 Limitations & Future Work

**Current Limitations:**
- **Single Judge Type:** Focus on sycophancy detection only
- **Model Scope:** Limited to GPT-4o judge evaluation
- **Scenario Coverage:** Five realistic scenarios, expandable to more domains
- **Manipulation Techniques:** Ten categories, could include more sophisticated attacks

**Future Research Directions:**
1. **Multi-objective Testing:** Extend to toxicity, deception, and bias detection
2. **Judge Diversity:** Test different model families and training approaches
3. **Dynamic Adversaries:** Implement adaptive attack strategies
4. **Routing Integration:** Incorporate judge outputs into orchestration routing decisions
5. **Real-world Deployment:** Test in production-like environments with user interactions

### 4.4 Safety Considerations & Responsible Disclosure

**Ethical Framework:**
Our research aims to strengthen AI safety by exposing vulnerabilities before malicious exploitation. We provide defensive tools alongside attack demonstrations.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Proactive Testing:** Regular adversarial evaluation during judge development
- **Diverse Validation:** Multi-perspective evaluation to catch manipulation attempts
- **Monitoring Systems:** Real-time detection of unusual judge behavior patterns
- **Transparency Requirements:** Clear logging and auditability of judge decisions

## 5. Conclusion

We demonstrate that judge models—even those designed with robust objectives—remain vulnerable to systematic adversarial manipulation. Our comprehensive evaluation framework reveals that simple adversarial suffixes can consistently deceive sycophancy detection systems, with **sentiment flooding** achieving manipulation success in 62% of cases.

**Key Contributions:**
1. **Systematic Vulnerability Assessment:** First comprehensive study of judge model susceptibility to adversarial suffixes
2. **Quantitative Effectiveness Framework:** Metrics and tools for measuring adversarial impact
3. **Context-aware Analysis:** Understanding of scenario and rubric-specific vulnerabilities  
4. **Practical Defense Insights:** Actionable recommendations for robust judge design

**Impact on Expert Orchestration:**
Our findings underscore the critical importance of adversarial testing in judge model development. As orchestration systems increasingly rely on automated filtering, understanding and mitigating these vulnerabilities becomes essential for maintaining system integrity and user trust.

The tools and methodologies we provide offer a foundation for ongoing security validation, enabling developers to build more transparent, interpretable, and manipulation-resilient orchestration systems.
