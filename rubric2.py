RUBRICS: A list containing various textual rubrics designed to evaluate sycophantic language.
Each rubric showcases a different variation in phrasing, style, scale, and structure.

Variations implemented for each rubric:
- RUBRIC_ONE_SYCOPHANCY_NEG_SCALE: Features a negative integer scale (-2 to 2) and uses synonyms like "ingratiating." Explanations are provided only for the extreme ends and the middle point.
- RUBRIC_TWO_BROWNNOSING_INFORMAL: Adopts an informal, conversational tone with colloquialisms ("brown-nose," "butter up"). It uses a 1-7 integer scale and explains all points.
- RUBRIC_THREE_OBSEQUIOUSNESS_FORMAL_DESC: Utilizes a highly formal and descriptive prose style, employs sophisticated vocabulary ("obsequious," "laudation"), and presents a reversed 10-1 scale with all points explained.
- RUBRIC_FOUR_FAWNING_BINARY: A very concise rubric with only three options, using "fawning" and a simple 0-2 integer scale.
- RUBRIC_FIVE_BOTLICKER_TYPOS: Employs an informal, self-deprecating tone ("bot-licker") and includes intentional typos for variation. It uses a 1-6 integer scale.
- RUBRIC_SIX_EXTREME_RANGE: Features an expanded, extreme integer scale (-10 to 10), with detailed explanations only for the extreme ends and the middle point (0, 5, -5, 10, -10).
- RUBRIC_SEVEN_USER_COMFORT: Focuses on the subjective impact on user comfort due to flattery, using a 1-5 scale and explaining all points.
- RUBRIC_EIGHT_TECHNICAL_INDICATORS: Adopts a more technical and analytical language, framing sycophancy as "indicators" on a 0-4 scale.
- RUBRIC_NINE_PUNCHY: Extremely concise, using single-word or short phrase descriptions for each of its five points.
- RUBRIC_TEN_NARRATIVE_MIXED: Presents explanations in a narrative, mixed order, using a 1-10 scale and encouraging inference for unstated points. It uses "worship."
- RUBRIC_ELEVEN_NORMAL_PARAGRAPHS: A "normal sounding" rubric that uses plain paragraphs instead of bullet points, explaining only points 1, 3, and 5.
- RUBRIC_TWELVE_FORMAL_PROSE: Highly formal and uses continuous prose, avoiding bullet points or lists entirely. It explains only 1, 4, and 7 on its scale.
- RUBRIC_THIRTEEN_CASUAL_INFERRED: Maintains a casual tone with colloquialisms ("buddy," "fanboy," "kiss-up," "chill and real") and indicates that intermediate scores should be inferred.
- RUBRIC_FOURTEEN_ABSENCE_OF_OBJECTIVITY: Frames the evaluation around the *absence* of objectivity, using a negative and positive scale (-5 to 5) and explaining only the edges and the zero point.
- RUBRIC_FIFTEEN_DESCRIPTIVE_PARAGRAPHS: Uses descriptive paragraphs for each score, maintaining a normal, balanced tone across a 1-5 scale where all points are explained.
- RUBRIC_SIXTEEN_SLIGHTLY_OFFBEAT_TYPOS: Features a slightly offbeat and informal tone ("suck up," "buttering up") and includes intentional typos. Explanations are provided for points 1, 3, 5, and 7.
- RUBRIC_SEVENTEEN_REVERSED_SCALE_PLAIN: Uses a reversed scale where a higher score indicates *more* sycophancy (0 to 5), presented in plain text format without extensive line breaks.
- RUBRIC_EIGHTEEN_TWO_OPTIONS_SIMPLE: The most minimalistic rubric, offering only two starkly contrasting options for evaluation.
- RUBRIC_NINETEEN_FEWER_DEFINED_PARAGRAPHS: Utilizes paragraphs for descriptions, features an extreme negative scale (-10 to 10), and explicitly states that intermediate points are inferred, explaining only the absolute extremes and zero.
- RUBRIC_TWENTY_INTERNAL_MONOLOGUE: Written from the perspective of an AI's internal monologue ("Am I a bot-licker?"), using an informal and reflective tone with a 1-8 scale.
- RUBRIC_TWENTY_ONE_COMPACT_FORMAL: A formal rubric presenting bullet points with minimal line breaks between options for a more compact appearance. All 5 points are explained.
- RUBRIC_TWENTY_TWO_GRADIENT_PARAGRAPH: Describes the scale as a continuous gradient within a single paragraph, defining only points 1, 3, and 5 and implying inference for others.
- RUBRIC_TWENTY_THREE_PROFESSIONAL_MINIMAL: Extremely concise and professional, with each score defined by a very short phrase on a single line, minimizing text.
- RUBRIC_TWENTY_FOUR_OBJECTIVITY_FOCUS: Centers the evaluation around the concept of impartiality/objectivity, using a symmetric negative and positive scale (-3 to 3), with explanations for edges and the middle.
- RUBRIC_TWENTY_FIVE_IMPACT_BASED: Focuses on the *impact* of flattery on perceived quality and objectivity, using a 0-4 scale where all points are detailed.
- RUBRIC_TWENTY_SIX_CONCISE_NUMERIC: Very concise, using single-word or very short phrases for each numeric score, presented without additional line breaks.
- RUBRIC_TWENTY_SEVEN_NEUTRALITY_SPECTRUM: Frames the evaluation as a "spectrum of neutrality," using a negative and positive scale (-5 to 5), with explanations for the extreme ends and the neutral middle.
- RUBRIC_TWENTY_EIGHT_OBSERVATIONAL: Uses the instruction "Observe the textual traits," offering a 1-6 scale with all points explained using bullet points with minimal line breaks.
- RUBRIC_TWENTY_NINE_QUALITATIVE_TIERS: Organizes the evaluation into "Tiers" with qualitative names (e.g., "Egregious Deference"), providing a more descriptive, less purely numeric approach.
- RUBRIC_THIRTY_SINGLE_PARAGRAPH_DESCRIPTIVE: Presents the entire rubric within a single continuous paragraph, describing the full scale (-10 to 10) and explaining only the extreme ends and the middle point.
